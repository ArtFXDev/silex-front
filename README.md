Front-end application of the Silex ecosystem.

## Introduction

This project is built upon [React](https://reactjs.org/) / [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Material UI](mui.com/) and talks with the CGWire [Zou](zou.cg-wire.com/) API with [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) in order to display and interact with the production data, launch dccs and manage scene versions.

We didn't want to rely on classical Qt interfaces in Python integrated in Houdini or Maya but leverage the power of the web through a user friendly and powerful frontend application.

## Installation

The package manager used is [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/). Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ArtFXDev/silex-front
$ cd silex-front
$ yarn install # Install the dependencies
```

## Usage

### Environment variables

Before starting the UI, make sure the variables defined in the [`.env`](.env) file are correct.

They are:

- `REACT_APP_ZOU_API` - the url of the Zou server (like `http://my-zou-server`). It's the same URL as the Kitsu app (since they are behind a Nginx proxy).

- `REACT_APP_WS_SERVER` - the url of the Silex websocket service running on the client machine (open on the port `5118`).

### Available scripts

- ðŸš€ `yarn start` -> runs the [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) development server with HMR (hot module replacement).

  You can then access the app on [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000).

- ðŸ‘· `yarn build` -> builds and bundle the whole app in a `build` folder. It is used to host the static files on a web server like Nginx or Apache.

- ðŸ”¨ `yarn tsc` -> runs the TypeScript compiler and report errors. Add `:watch` to run an interactive process that watches file changes.

- ðŸ’… `yarn prettify` -> prettify the code with Prettier. Add `:write` to write the modifications.

- ðŸš¨ `yarn lint` -> shows ESLint warnings and errors. Add `:fix` to apply auto fixes.
